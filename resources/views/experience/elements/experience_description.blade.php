    <p class="small_title">What we’ll do</p>
    <p>First, I'll show you around the SKOBA workshop and we'll perform the basics of handmade
        notebook production.
        Then, you will make your own notebook from authentic, locally-sourced materials such as
        antique Czech
        magazines, books and posters. You will experience the joys of making something unique with
        your own
        hands and creating an original notebook in a sustainable and socially-impactful way. And of
        course,
        the notebook is yours to take home and use!</p>
