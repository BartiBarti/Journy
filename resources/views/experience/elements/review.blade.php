        <p>“Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying for the gods to have mercy on us all? The gods
            have no mercy,
            that’s why they are gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother
            had just
            died, you see. I didn’t really understand the concept of death. The finality of it. I
            thought
            if I prayed very very hard, the gods would return her to me. I was four.”</p>

        <p>“My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles
            and powers,
            he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And my Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her
            father.
            But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your king, treason shall never
            go unpunished.
            Sir Ilyn, bring me his head!”</p>

        <p>“The snow drifted down and down, all in ghostly silence, and lay thick and unbroken on
            the ground.
            It was a place of whites and blacks and greys. White towers and white snow and white
            statues,
            black shadows and black trees, the dark grey sky above. A pure world, Sansa thought. I
            do not
            belong here. Yet she stepped out all the same.” </p>

            your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch
            don't care
            if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in
            their armies
            and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down. It's you and me that matters to me
            and you.

            neck.”</p>
